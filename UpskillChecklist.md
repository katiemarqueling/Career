Hi! Below you will find a checklist of the skills I am learning to become a more attractive canidate for a carrer in technology. While I recognize some of these concepts take years to master, I would like to have a basic understanding of these skills by March 15th, 2023 (no, I dont plan to sleep).

If you work in technology and have any advice on skills to add to this list, please open an issue. If you are a recruiter and would like to contact me about open jobs, you can reach me at katie@marqueling.com.
