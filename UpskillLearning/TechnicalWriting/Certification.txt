- What a reader profile is
    - A reader profile is an analysis of your reader's specific needs, backgrounds, abilities, and experiences. Developing a profile of 
      your readers will give you helpful insight into how they will react to your ideas and how they will use your document.

- The eight guidelines for writing plain sentences
    - make the subject of the sentence what the sentence is about 
    - use the "doer" as the subject of the sentence
    - use a verb to express the action, or what the doer is doing 
    - put the subject of the sentence early in the sentence

    - eliminate redundancy in sentences
    - write sentences that are "breathing length"
- The four types of sentences used in paragraphs
    - transitional sentence: gap between two sentences
    - topic sentence: claim or statement rest of paragraph is going to support
    - support sentence: bulk, prove claim, (examples, facts, data, reasoning...)
    - point sentence: positioned to create a link from one topic to the next
- When it is appropriate to use plain writing style 
    - Plain style stresses clear wording and simple prose. It is often used to instruct, teach, 
      or present information. Plain style works best in documents like technical description, 
      instructions, and activity reports. 
- When it is appropriate to use persuasive writing style 
    - There are times when you need to influence people to accept your ideas and take action. 
      In these situations, persuasive style allows you to add energy and vision to your writing and 
      speaking. This style works best with proposals, letters, articles, public presentations, and reports.
- The four persuasion techniques: 
    - Elevate the tone: trick inner voices emotion
    - Use similes and analogies: help the reader to understand difficult concepts
    - Use metaphors: create or reinforce a particular perspective that you want readers to adopt toward your subjects or ideas
    - Change the pace: change intensity of the document
- The four strategies for improving the writing style on websites and why these are useful:
    - Keep sentences short: shorter than sentences on paper

    - Create a consistent tone: tone reflects topic
