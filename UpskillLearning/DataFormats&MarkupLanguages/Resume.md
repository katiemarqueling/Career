<i>After chasing my dreams of improving police-community trust relations for two years, my allergy to pepper spray is sending me on to new adventures. I am currently seeking a position that will challenge me with hard work, and improve my adaptability and leadership skills. I hope to bring my discipline, integrity, and positive attitude to a future team.</i>
