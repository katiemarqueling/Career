<h2 class="subtitles">Morning Routine</h2>
    <p>Tendy wakes when the sun has just begun to crest the houses on Savannah Street. After fifteen minutes of
        contemplating whether to get up, she begrudgingly gets out of bed and performs her routine of stretches.
        While her humans woke many hours before her, she needs to ensure they know that she is up.
        Her preferred method to alert them is to violently slam her body on the floor till the whole house shakes.
        She has trained the humans to immediately come greet her,so she can give the approved amount of smooches
        for her mood that morning.</p>
    <p>Tendy then waits at the tops of the stairs and supervises while her humans set out her bandana for the day
        and prepares her leash at the walk. Once she has determined that this task was done to her liking,
        she makes her way down the stairs and to the door. Here she sits in the perfect posting to chomp on the
        harness as it is being put on. Her humans open the door and she patiently waits till her human to say “okay”
        for her to exit. She gets excited when they tell her she was a “good girl” when all she did was walk out a
        door”</p>
    <p>Tendy then performs the daunting task of walking her humans to the far park in the neighborhood,
        protecting them from squirrels on the way. She may even find a desirable stick on the way. Once Tendy
        determines she is ready for breakfast,she begins to lead everyone home. </p>
    <p>Once she arrives at the front door,Tendy sits and waits for her humans to take off her harness. Again,
        her humans open the door and tell her “okay” to walk through the door. She still doesn't
        understand why they do it, but she sure does like being told she's a “good girl”, so she puts up with it. </p>
    <p>She promptly makes her way to the food bowl and waits for her humans to put away her walk supplies,
        make her breakfast,and refresh her water. After her human places her bowl on the ground and gives her her “okay”
        command, she inspects the bowl to ensure the kibble-pumpkin ratio is to her liking. Once she has approved the
        food,
        she feasts. </p>
    <p>She notifies her humans that she is finished by making her way to her custom made window porch. Here her
        humans dress her in her bandana for the day before tucking her in with the fluffiest blanket in the house.
        She acknowledges that this blanket was a very special gift her grandma gave her mom,
        but what is moms is Tendies too. Tendy gets comfortable as she prepares to spend most of the day laying on
        her porch performing some of her favorite activities: snoring,
        dreaming about squirrels, farting, eating treats,and watching cars go by.</p>
<h2 class="subtitles">Hiking</h2>
    <p> On the weekend Tendy likes to go on hikes. Recently Angel Falls,
        High Shoals Falls, Lower Black Falls have all been greeted by Tendies presence.
        Tendy prefers hikes that are between two and four miles long and have a waterfall.
        She quite enjoys getting into the water and splashing around. </p>
