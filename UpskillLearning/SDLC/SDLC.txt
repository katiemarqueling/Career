Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

-Purpose
    - Created to develop and test software that accuately meets cilent expectaion and does so in a time and cost effectie manner.

-Basic Phases   
    1. Plan
        -Identify current problems
        -What does the client want?

            -goals
        -Define scope of project
            -purpose
            -boundaries
    2. Define
        -Define and document requirements
        -SRS (Software Requirement Specification)
    3. Design
        -UI 
        -Programming
        -Communication
        -Architecture
        -Platforms
    4. Build
        -Organization Guidelines
            -Language used 
            -Compilers
    5. Test
        -Identy bugs and continously fix till SRS is meet
    6. Deploy and Maintain
        -Typically deployed in a testing enviroment first.
        -Fix bugs once deployed over the software course of life.
