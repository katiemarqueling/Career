    <h1>Life of Tendy</h1>
    <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
    <p>Tendy wakes when the sun has just begun
        to crest the houses on Savannah Street.
        After fifteen minutes of contemplating whether
        to get up, she begrudgingly gets out of bed
        and performs her routine of stretches.
        While her humans woke many hours before her,
        she needs to ensure they know that she is up.
        Her preferred method to alert them is to violently
        slam her body on the floor till the whole house shakes.
        She has trained the humans to immediately come
        greet her, so she can give the approved amount
        of smooches for her mood that morning.</p>
    <p>Tendy then waits at the tops of the stairs and
        supervises while her humans set out her bandana
        for the day and prepares her leash at the walk.
        Once she has determined that this task was done
        to her liking, she makes her way down the stairs
        and to the door. Here she sits in the perfect
        posting to chomp on the harness as it is being
        put on. Her humans open the door and she patiently
        waits till her human to say “okay” for her to exit.
        She gets excited when they tell her she was a
        “good girl” when all she did was walk out a door”</p>
    <p>Tendy then performs the daunting task of walking
        her humans to the far park in the neighborhood,
        protecting them from squirrels on the way.
        She may even find a desirable stick on the way.
        Once Tendy determines she is ready for breakfast,
        she begins to lead everyone home. </p>
    <p>Once she arrives at the front door,
        Tendy sits and waits for her humans to take off her harness.
        Again, her humans open the door and tell her
        “okay” to walk through the door. She still doesn't
        understand why they do it, but she sure does like
        being told she's a “good girl”, so she puts up with it. </p>
    <p>She promptly makes her way to the food bowl and waits
        for her humans to put away her walk supplies, make her
        breakfast, and refresh her water. After her human places
        her bowl on the ground and gives her her “okay” command,
        she inspects the bowl to ensure the kibble-pumpkin ratio
        is to her liking. Once she has approved the food,
        she feasts. </p>
    <p>She notifies her humans that she is finished by making
        her way to her custom made window porch. Here her humans
        dress her in her bandana for the day before tucking her
        in with the fluffiest blanket in the house.
        She acknowledges that this blanket was a very special
        gift her grandma gave her mom, but what is moms is Tendies too.
        Tendey gets comfortable as she prepares to spend most of the day
        laying on her porch performing some of her favorite activities:
        snoring, dreaming about squirrels, farting, eating treats, and
        watching cars go by.</p>
    <h2>Porch</h2>
    <p> One of Tendies favorite aspects of life is laying on her porch.</p>
