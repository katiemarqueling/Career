To Whom it May Concern,

In today’s fast-paced market, employers seek strong and dependable employees who can foresee and prepare for tomorrow’s trends. As you work toward your always shifting business growth objectives, I'm confident that I can provide the traits you look for in a valuable employee.  Attached, please find my resume which indicates multiple leadership skills, showcases a resilient self-motivator, and displays a high quality of commitment to continuous learning. 

Sadly, I was forced to cut my law enforcement career short due to my severe allergy to the active ingredient in pepper spray. I regret that I won’t be able to serve my community in the way I had envisioned, but I also recognize the tremendous opportunities outside of city government. Since my Freshman year of college, I’ve lived with my boyfriend and our mutual friends, who all had a background in Computer Science. I’ve long had an interest in their fields of study, but not as a practitioner, rather as a translator. I quickly found out that there is value in the interface between the developers who just want to write code and be left alone, and the customer, who wants to feel like they’re talking to a human being who listens and understands their concerns. That’s the value I hope to provide to your organization.

Given the opportunity to meet, you are certain to find me to be outgoing and friendly in nature.  This allows me to interact well with different levels of personalities and I pride myself on bringing the right amount of enthusiasm into any equation. I look forward to learning more about your company, its plans and goals, and how I might contribute to its continued success.

Respectfully,

Katie Marqueling
