API Notes

- What is an API
  - Application Programming Interface
  - CRM: Customer Relationship Management
  - A set of definitions and protocols to build and integrate application software
  - API is the messenger that takes request and tells a system what you want to do (waiter).
  - Stores and retrieves necessary data.
  - Helps you access information for data- driven decision-making.
  - Can build programs that run searches on the data the server is hosting and transform that informaiton 
    into a different usable format (Uber + Google Maps).
- API Management Tools/ HTTP Clients
  - Mulesoft
  - Postman
  - Paw
- API Architecture
  - SOAP APIs  
    - Simple Object Access Protocols
    - Rigid structure and independence from any specific programming language.
    - Less popular than once was.
  - REST APIs
    - Representational State Transfer
    - Flexiable, more like a style guide than a structure.
  - RESTful APIs
    - Has all of the features of REST architecture, but it differs slightly in that it has a transport protocol and 
      makes cached information accessible at any time rather than displacing it if left unused. More flexible, but less secure. 
    - Standard or best-practice for web APIs
    - HTTP Request
- 5 methods/actions of APIs: (HTTP Verbs)
  - GET: This method is used to retrieve a data from database / server
  - POST: This method is used to create a new record
  - PUT: This method is used to modify / replace the record
  - PATCH: This method is used to modify / update the record
  - DELETE: This method is used to delete the record
- API Calls
  - Steps 
    - Client request
    - Retrieval of requested information
    - Delivery of that information from the server to the client
  - Header
    - HTTP verb
    - Universal Resource Indicator (URI) of server that you requested info from
    - Content type and link
    - Meta data
    - API key 
  - Status Code
    - 2: your request was sucessful
    - 3: auth
    - 4: something went wrong 
    - 5: something went wrong on our end, server error
-Pull Data from API
  - Buid a URL from existing documention
  - api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}
- Describe an example of an API using the analogy of a car
    - A partner wants to purchase a new car for their significant other. They go shopping on Subaru's website to search for new cars. 
      This sends a HTTP request to Subaru's server to GET a list of all the models of cars. The website responds with a JSON list.  
      Subaru's website then reads this response and displays it on the web page in a human-readable format. After performing several GETs, 
      through searching the various models, they decide on a Crosstrek and add it to the shopping cart. This created a POST request where 
      a new record is created in Subaru's database containing the model, package, color, price, etc.
    - One afternoon, after driving a steep road to a hike, they decide that their lifestyle requires the "sport" package with the bigger 
      engine. They go to the checkout and update the kit to reflect the sports package. This triggers a PATCH, where everything else remains 
      the same, but the package changes from basic to sport.
    - After noticing that his partner spent a sizable chunk on a "mystery gift," they were doubting if they could afford this car at this 
      time. To take a cheaper route, they initiate a PUT request where the entire Crosstrek data is replaced with an Impreza.
    - They come home one day, and their partner is excited that the mystery gift has arrived. The partner walks them out to the driveway, 
      where a new Subaru Crosstrek Sport is sitting. Realizing that they now have a new car, they trigger a DELETE request to cancel the order.
