Hi, I'm Katie! Here you can find my 
[resume](https://github.com/katiemarqueling/Career/blob/main/Resume%26CoverLetter/MarquelingResume.pdf) and a 
[cover letter](https://github.com/katiemarqueling/Career/blob/main/Resume%26CoverLetter/MarquelingCoverLetter.pdf). Furthermore, you can track my plan to [upskill](https://github.com/katiemarqueling/Career/blob/main/UpskillChecklist.md)!

Growing up, I struggled to learn technology. I lived in a household where everyone worked with and quickly adapted to the ever-changing technological advancements. I relied on these members of my house to solve all of my problems with little to no explanation. When I went off to college, I realized that I, along with most of the women in my dorm, were not technologically literate. Therefore, I made it my mission to become self-sufficient, and I applied for a job at my university's technology department in customer support. While I was substantially underqualified for the position, the hiring manager appreciated my desire and passion to challenge myself, and I was hired. I quickly excelled at explaining advanced technological topics to non-technical people, as I understood what it was like to struggle without a willing or patient teacher.

Looking back at this opportunity during college, I realized that the field of technology was for me, but not as a practitioner but rather as a translator. I have since made it my life's goal to help those who are technologically challenged understand and use advanced technologies without the help of customer support, through detailed documentation. 

Immediately after this revelation, I began to study to become a technical communicator. I learned about topics such as version control, data formats, markup languages, APIs, CI/CD, and search engine optimization. I joined the Society of Technical Communication (STC), took and passed the exam to become a Certified Professional Technical Communicator, completed the STC TechComm Fundamentals Bootcamp, and began a Masters of Science in Technology with a Technical Communication Concentration at Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis.

While I am not the most experienced technical communicator, I can assure you that I am a valuable asset to your company. Let me prove to you my curiosity, elastic energy, and positive attitude.

Thank you for your time.

Katie
