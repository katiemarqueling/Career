# Katie Marqueling
Hi, I'm Katie! Here you can find my 
[resume](https://github.com/katiemarqueling/Career/blob/main/Resume%26CoverLetter/Resume_Marqueling.pdf) and a 
[cover letter](https://github.com/katiemarqueling/Career/blob/main/Resume%26CoverLetter/CoverLetter_Marqueling.pdf). Furthermore, you can track my plan to [upskill](https://github.com/katiemarqueling/Career/blob/main/UpskillChecklist.md)!

I spent the last few years pursing a career as a police officer. I unfortunately had to leave due to a severe allergy to pepper spray. I regret that I wonâ€™t be able to serve my community in the way I had envisioned, but I also recognize the tremendous opportunities outside of city government.

Growing up, I struggled to learn technology. I grew up in a household where everyone worked and quickly adapted to the ever-changing technological advancements. I relied on these members of my house to solve all of my problems with little to no explanation. When I went off to college, I realized that I and most of the other females in my dorm were not capable of solving simple tasks. As someone who doesn't follow the beaten path, I made it my mission to be self-sufficient. I shortly thereafter applied for a job at my university's technology department in customer support. While the hiring manager acknowledged that I was deeply underqualified for the position, they appreciated my desire and passion to challenge myself, and I was hired. As most of my coworkers were computer science majors, it quickly became apparent that there is value in the interface between the developers, who just want to write code and be left alone, and the customers. I excelled at explaining advanced technological topics to non-technical people, as I understood what it felt like to struggle so many years ago to understand the topic. I then realized that the field of technology was for me, but not as a practitioner but rather as a translator. I have made it my mission to help those who are technologically challenged understand and use advanced technologies without the help of customer support, through detailed documentation.
